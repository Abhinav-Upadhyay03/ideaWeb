## There are some issues that this product face that could not be addressed due to lack of technical knowledge.

- The user authentication is a simple one, so anyone can spam a lot of emails and passwords and stop the proper function of server. This can be stopped by using some authentication APIs
- The product uses local SQLAlchemy and cannot be scaled at all.
- People can click the like button as many times as they want and this if not controlled could possibly bring down the whole database.
- People can spam the website with dummy ideas, or absolute gibberish.
- There is not ranking mechanism. This can be solved with one like per person and even seperation of ideas according to domains.
- The ideas are not sorted to different types.

These are some of the issues that must be remedied to make this project better..
